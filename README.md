# CPlusPlus-ModulesCpp
Those modules of C++ are designed to help you understand the specifities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming!

# Cpp 00
| Module | Exercise | Title | About |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPP00 | ex00 | Megaphone |Small program, you will have to use the `std::toupper()` function |
| CPP00 | ex01 | Phonebook |Small but tedious program, you will use `std::cin`, `std::getline`, and `std::setw`|
| CPP00 | ex02 | The Job of your Dreams |Very tedious, you are given a .hpp a main and a log file and you have to implement the cpp class. |
