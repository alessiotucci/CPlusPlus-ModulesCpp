# CPlusPlus-ModulesCpp
Those modules of C++ are designed to help you understand the specifities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming!

| Module | Exercise | Title | About |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPP00 | ex00 | Megaphone |Small program, you will have to use the `std::toupper()` function |
