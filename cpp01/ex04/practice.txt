[Iverson] We're sitting here, and I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're talking about practice. I mean, listen, we're sitting here talking about practice, not a game, not a game, not a game, but we're talking about practice. Not the game that I go out there and die for and play every game like it's my last, but we're talking about practice, man. How silly is that?

Now I know that I'm supposed to lead by example and all that, but I'm not shoving that aside like it don't mean anything. I know it's important, I honestly do, but we're talking about practice. We're talking about practice, man. We're talking about practice. We're talking about practice. We're not talking about the game. We're talking about practice. When you come to the arena, and you see me play, you see me play, don't you? You see me give everything I've got, right? But we're talking about practice right now.

We're talking about practice. Man, I look, I hear you. It's funny to me too. I mean, it's strange, it's strange to me too, but we're talking about practice, man. We're not even talking about the game, the actual game, when it matters. We're talking about practice.
